      This page is a personal project that I use as part of my studies to
      explore and learn both backend and frontend technologies. Initially, the
      project was built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I am now
      transitioning it into a full-stack application to meet the requirements of
      my studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The backend is powered by <strong>Node.js</strong> and
      <strong>MongoDB</strong>, both of which are already implemented. I have
      also integrated <strong>JWT</strong> for secure user authentication.
      Moving forward, I will be enhancing the backend further with features like
      <strong>monitoring</strong> using <strong>Grafana</strong>, optimizing for
      scalability and performance. On the frontend, I am using
      <strong>Vue.js</strong> to create a dynamic, component-based user
      interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site will continue to evolve as I develop my skills and add new
      features to meet the objectives of both the frontend and backend modules.
      Feel free to explore the features and technologies I've implemented. If
      you have any questions or just want to say hello, feel free to

    <p>Thank you for visiting and showing interest in my learning project!</p>
