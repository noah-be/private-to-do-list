            <strong>🍪 Got Cookies? Yes, I Do!</strong>
            <p>Ahoy there, web traveler! Just letting you know that <strong>I've loaded this site with delicious
                    digital
                    cookies</strong>. Why? Well, to make your browsing experience 'yummier', of course!</p>
            <p>And, maybe, just maybe, <strong>to keep an eye on every click, scroll, and hover you
                    make</strong> (in
                the friendliest way possible, I promise!).</p>
            <p>So, if you're okay with sharing your digital crumbs with me (and my 9324 partners that are at
                least as
                trustworthy as I am 💀), hit the <strong>"Aye Aye, Captain!"</strong> button. If not, well, I'll
                try not
                to take it too personally. Remember, I am watching... sort of! 😜</p>
