This project is a personal learning initiative focused on understanding the basics of web development. It includes practical implementations of user authentication and task management to provide a hands-on experience with essential web technologies. Tailored as a self-guided exploration, this project documents my progress and serves as a reference for fundamental concepts in building and deploying web applications. It is designed for personal use, to track learning milestones and challenges encountered along the way.
